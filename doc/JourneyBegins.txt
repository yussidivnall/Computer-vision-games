Ok, So Open Kinect, here we go...

followed some tutorial and installed, openCV, kinect stuff etc. 
I can run glview fine.
problem is, when i try to compile it's missing some libaries.

g++ glview.c -o glview -I /usr/local/include/opencv -L /usr/local/lib -lm -lcv -lhighui -lcvaux | head

Ok, Well it looks like, when building the glview example, that OpenGL on my system is under GL not OpenGL.
Need to change the include path
I also coped some of the libfreecnet headers to the local dir do be safe

$cpp glview.c -o glview -lGL -lGLU
glview works
